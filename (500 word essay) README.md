# CSI-2300-Program-Project
 Welcome to Our Quiz/Survey! Our goal for this project was to make a survey or Quiz over topics that would interest the user and have our program calculate and output which outcome best describes the user based on their answers or choices. Our first section of the program is called QuizSurvey. Here you are greeted by a Frame labeled Survey Intro and are granted two choices: Marvel or Personality. In order to have inputs for both choices and create an action where it calls a different class depending on the user's choice, we have created buttons for each option and changed the Actionevent function to arg instead of event so that we could differentiate the Buttons using the instance getSource(). If for instance the user clicked on Marvel, the user would activate the code in a file called "MarvelGUI." Here, there are 10 questions and the input as well as output uses the JOptionPane function. For the JOptionPanes, there are overall 11, where as the first one specifies. Some other functionalities are that the use of if else statements, switch case. The marvel quiz survey tels you what type of marvel Character you are based on the answer you provide.  The main highlight of this project is the GUI. Various functionalities of GUI were used like JOptionPanel. Frames spinner ect these are just the few things that were included in this project. classes were implemented. Methods were used and other minute stuff were added in this project that were learned in this class. The next feature that was added was the Personality Survey that encompases different features and methods. After the personality Button is pressed, the QuizSurvey.java calls a class called PersonalityGUI. Here, the PersonalityGUI starts off with making the needed imports in order to use features such as JFrame and GridBagComstraimts. After the imports, the class implements the ActionListener to make an easier pathway to the different JButton Actionevents. the class also defines majority of it's used variables outside of main so that the variables can be easily accessed from anywhere in the class. The next objective goal in the program was to create Questions for the user to answer and pick. In PersonalityGUI there are three sections of questions: Leader, Anger, and Social. In each section, these questions test whether you are more or less of this topic depending on your choice. These questions also have a cool feature in which it uses a randNumber which randomizes for each run of the program. This makes it so you can have different questions if the user decides to play again. Next, the program uses JLabels, JButtons and GridBagConstraints to display the Questions and Choices on the JFrame. After the user clicks on thier choice, the program calls a class called Feedback, which is derived from QPoints. This makes it so the Object Personality can access both classes. The QPoints also has public variables so that Feedback can easily acces them. Overall, this project uses many features, methods, and classes in order to create a unique survey.
